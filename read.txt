luminaries of the field let me congratulate all the winners - and I believe that your efforts will help India to the driver's seat of a fast changing world. I believe that your talent and efforts will definitely bear fruit. There was a time when it took the world centuries to understand India. It was around 1995 I was on an official visit to Taiwan - it was some 6-7 days in duration - my interpreter was an IT professional. We got acquitted quite well and around the last day he asked me - if you don't feel bad I want to know something - I asked him to go ahead and he asked - do you still have snake charmers in India? In the fag end of 20th century a Taiwanese engineer was asking me about the age old picture of India that had been painted over centuries. Years of work haven't been able to paint a makeover. But the IT professionals - the kids between 18 to 25 did what we could not do. They changed the idea of India. This shows the clout this sector wields and even today if we are to eke out a place in the changing world order we will have to focus on science and technology. Every country - see that we adopt a technology is not enough - the need is to innovate - to tailor it according to our needs - we must emphasis on innovation. During Vajpayee ji's government lots of initiatives were taken - a separate IT ministry was set up for the first time, an IT act was passed, a taskforce was set up and we made a good beginning. But unfortunately in the last decade and because of the 2G scam - which is quite infamous. People think about this scam in terms of money - but I measure it differently. I concede that this scam have been a major setback to the speed of development in this sector, to the aspirations of the youths of this sector. This setback goes far beyond the monetary loss incurred. How to bring the country out of this low is a major challenge. It was the biggest blow to the fastest developing sector
